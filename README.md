# The Odin Project :thinking:

## What is it  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is a free, open-source curriculum that teaches web development from the ground up. It covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Git, React, and back-end technologies like Node.js and Ruby on Rails, offering a structured path from beginner to job-ready developer. The curriculum includes hands-on projects, coding exercises, and real-world applications to reinforce learning.

## Is it worth doing  
The Odin Project is an excellent resource for self-taught developers looking for a structured and comprehensive learning path. It encourages active learning through projects and collaboration with the community. However, since it requires self-discipline and problem-solving skills, those who prefer guided instruction with direct mentorship might find it challenging.

## User interface

### Board  
After the game starts, an empty board is displayed with columns labeled **a**, **b**, **c** and rows labeled **1**, **2**, **3**. The user must input a valid column and row (e.g., `b1`) to place their mark.

If the selected cell is already occupied or the input is invalid, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted again to select a valid cell.

### Game Over  
The game ends when one of the players gets three marks in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally — and wins, or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.
